# "Finding northernmost baselines: high variability of landscape-level biomass on Eurasian polar desert islands" supplementary data


## Description of the data and file structure

1\. .Csv file including the data on in-situ plant biomass, species richness and vegetation cover as well as sampled NDVI values from drone imagery and Sentinel-2 satellite images

1.1.1 "biomass_cover_reformated.csv" - main dataframe with information on cover, biomass and sampled NDVI across the sites;

1.1.2 "biomass_cover_reformated_drone_sites_only.csv" - subset of the main dataframe used in the analysis;

1.2 "Species_biomass_per_plot.csv" - species count per plot;

1.3 "Summarized_data_fcover.csv*" - *min, median and max fractional vegetation cover values together with corresponding in-situ data;



A detailed description of the data sources and methodology could be found in the paper.
